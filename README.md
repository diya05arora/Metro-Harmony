# Metro-Harmony
In densely populated metro systems, commuters often face the challenge of finding available seats and planning their journey with comfort in mind. The lack of real-time information on seat availability and station-specific seating details results in inconvenience and discomfort during travel.

To address this, the project aims to develop a platform where metro travelers can actively update their seat status and station departure points. This real-time information will empower new passengers to make informed decisions about where to stand for a seat, promoting a more comfortable and harmonious metro experience for all commuters.

The project seeks to enhance the overall commuting experience by providing a seamless solution to the perpetual challenge of finding available seats in metro systems.
